###<span class="blue">Nothing's gonna change my love for you</span>

<span class="green">
> If I had to live my life without you near me<br/>
The days would all be empty<br/>
The nights would seem so long<br/>
With you I see forever oh so clearly<br/>
I might have been in love before<br/>
But it never felt this strong<br/>
Our dreams are young And we both know<br/>
they'll take us where we want to go<br/>
Hold me now<br/>
Touch me now<br/>
I don't want to live without you<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
One thing you can be sure of<br/>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
The world may change my whole life through<br/>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
If the road ahead is not so easy,<br/>
Our love will lead the way for us<br/>
Just like a guiding star<br/>
I'll be there for you if you should need me<br/>
You don't have to change a thing<br/>
I love you just the way you are<br/>
So come with me and share the view<br/>
I'll help you see forever too<br/>
Hold me now<br/>
Touch me now<br/>
I don't want to live without you<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
One thing you can be sure of<br/>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
The world may change my whole life through<br/>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
The world may change my whole life through<br/>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
One thing you can be sure of<br/>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
The world may change my whole life through<br/>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
One thing you can be sure of<br/>
I'll never ask for more than your love<br/>
Nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
You ought to know by now how much I love you<br/>
The world may change my whole life through<br/>
But nothing's gonna change my love for you<br/>
